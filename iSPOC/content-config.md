## About iSPoC

The iSPoC Policy Assistant is a pilot program designed to test the efficiency of information retrieval from non-clinical policies. This is an AI-powered chatbot helps staff quickly access and understand MHA's policy information without having to search through multiple documents.

As part of our digital transformation initiative, this tool aims to streamline administrative processes and improve staff access to important policy guidelines.

Your feedback during this pilot phase will help us enhance the system and expand its capabilities.
