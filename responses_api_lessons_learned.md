# Lessons Learned: Migration to OpenAI Responses API

## Overview

This document summarizes the key lessons learned during the migration of the MHA Digital Assistant from the OpenAI Assistant API to the new Responses API. The migration aimed to ensure future compatibility, improve performance, and leverage new features such as enhanced streaming and tool integration.

## 1. Key Technical Changes

- **API Model Shift:**  
  The migration required moving from the thread/run/message model of the Assistant API to the single-call, response-centric model of the Responses API.
- **Streaming Protocol:**  
  The Responses API uses a new SSE event schema, with text chunks delivered under `response.output_text.delta` events.
- **System Prompt Management:**  
  The system prompt is now loaded from an editable Markdown file, making prompt updates non-technical and version-controlled.
- **Configuration:**  
  All sensitive and environment-specific values (API keys, vector store IDs) are now managed via `.env` files.

## 2. Major Challenges and Solutions

### a. API Contract Changes

- **Delta Format:**  
  The new API emits text chunks as plain strings (`delta: "..."`) instead of objects (`delta: { value: "..." }`).  
  **Solution:** Updated the streaming handler to accept both formats for backward compatibility.

- **Event Names:**  
  The streaming handler initially only processed `response.delta` events, missing the new `response.output_text.delta` events.  
  **Solution:** Refactored the handler to process the correct event and extract text accordingly.

- **Chunk Ordering:**  
  The new API provides `content_index` for chunk ordering.  
  **Solution:** Used `content_index` to ensure multi-part responses are rendered in order.

### b. UI/UX Streaming

- **No Streaming in UI:**  
  The UI did not update because the streaming handler never fired for the new event names.  
  **Solution:** Fixed the event handler and added debug logs to confirm chunk delivery and rendering.

- **Empty Responses:**  
  The UI showed empty responses when the handler failed to extract text from the new delta format.  
  **Solution:** Patched the handler to accept both string and legacy object formats.

### c. Configuration and Environment

- **Hardcoded Values:**  
  Vector store IDs and system prompts were initially hardcoded.  
  **Solution:** Moved these to `.env` and Markdown files, respectively.

- **Prompt Editing:**  
  The system prompt is now imported as raw Markdown, allowing non-technical edits.

## 3. Best Practices and Recommendations

- **Always Check the Latest API Schema:**  
  OpenAI's APIs evolve rapidly; always consult the latest docs and community threads.
- **Handle Both Legacy and Current Formats:**  
  Accept both string and object delta formats for maximum compatibility.
- **Use content_index/output_index:**  
  For multi-part or multi-modal responses, always use provided indices for correct ordering.
- **Surface or Ignore Annotations Explicitly:**  
  Decide how to handle `response.output_text.annotation.added` events (e.g., for citations).
- **Robust Logging:**  
  Add detailed debug logs for request/response, streaming events, and UI updates.
- **Environment-Driven Configuration:**  
  Keep all secrets and environment-specific values out of code.

## 4. What Worked Well

- **Modular API Logic:**  
  The separation of API logic, UI, and configuration made the migration manageable.
- **Prompt as Markdown:**  
  Using Vite's `?raw` import for the system prompt enabled easy, version-controlled edits.
- **Debugging Tools:**  
  Enhanced logging and debug utilities were invaluable for diagnosing streaming and event issues.

## 5. What Could Be Improved

- **Earlier Detection of API Contract Changes:**  
  More proactive monitoring of OpenAI API changes would have reduced downtime.
- **Automated Streaming Tests:**  
  Automated tests for streaming and multi-part responses would catch regressions early.
- **Error Handling:**  
  More robust error handling for edge cases and unexpected event types.

## 7. Final Thoughts

Migrating to the Responses API was a significant but necessary step to ensure future compatibility and unlock new capabilities. The process highlighted the importance of robust event handling, environment-driven configuration, and keeping up with evolving API contracts. The lessons learned here will inform future migrations and ongoing maintenance.
