This reconciliation must be countersigned by the home manager. \nThe manager and administration manager on their behalf must ensure that a record of all money kept in the home or scheme is maintained correctly on Caresys including the date deposited, returned, or used (including the purpose for which used). A printed and signed receipt must be kept in the residents file for all transactions entered on CareSys.\nFor each petty cash submission there must be a reconciliation of the sub-imprest balance.\nThe sum of money held in the sub-imprest for individuals but not yet banked must equal the amount of the sub-imprest.\nWhen cash is received from or on behalf of a resident, the following must be recorded in Caresys:\nAmount of money\nDate received.\nFrom whom received?\nA Caresys generated receipt is also to be given to the individuals or representative from Caresys, signed by the member or colleague. \nWhen money is returned, the following must be recorded in Caresys:\nDate returned.\nWho returned the money?\nMoney held on behalf of individuals must be:\nReconciled to the balance in Caresys at least monthly and validated by the home manager however reconciliation twice monthly is advised.\nRetirement Living Schemes\nA record of cash deposited must be recorded on the schemes Retirement Living Money Safekeeping Record for each individual whose personal spending money is managed by MHA, and must show:\nThe date\nReceipt number\nAmount deposited / Amount withdrawn.\nBalance\nTransaction details\nIndividuals’ or representative's signature, for each movement of money\nA monthly audit of all individuals' money must be completed and signed by a manager. This audit can be completed using the Safe Inventory Log and Audit Form.\nProcedure for Storing Valuables\nCare Homes\nSafe inventory checks help to reduce the risk of errors and / or fraud regarding the personal monies and valuables of those using MHA’s services.\nStore items in plastic money bags or plastic zip bags one per person / item(s). The bag must be clearly labelled with the person’s name, item, date of ‘hand-in’ and signature of receiver. Do not use paper envelopes as they degrade / tear.\nFor large or bulky valuable items that cannot be accommodated in a safe, the next of kin or advocate (chosen with the agreement of the individual and in accordance with the individual's wishes) must be approached and the item passed to them for safe keeping. In which case, this must be recorded on the Safe Inventory Log and Audit Form. See Appendix 1 for the step-by-step procedure for recording on the safe inventory checklist.\nAll valuable items in and out of the safe must be logged using the Safe Inventory Log and Audit Form inclusive of the following information:\nThe type of item\nThe date they were deposited and / or taken out of the safe\nThe owner of item \nProvide a description of the item - be specific in the description of valuables (i.e., no mention of gold or precious stones as you cannot validate the material, so use words such as shiny white metal, clear stones etc and photograph wearing)\nValuables must be photographed (preferably with the person wearing the item), labelled with the person’s name & date and digitally stored.\nUse the notes column to record what has happened to the item(s) when they have been taken out of the safe (i.e., handed back to individual or family.\nItems being removed from the date can be ‘archived’ from the form.\nThe following diagram (1) is a flow chart depicting the process of putting money and valuables “in and out” of the safe:\nRetirement Living Schemes\nRetirement Living Schemes are not permitted to store valuables on behalf of residents, in exceptional circumstances (for example, a lost valuable is found), the manager should store the item in the safe and contact the NOK as soon as possible to hand the valuable over to them. For advice on this, and for abandoned items, managers should seek support from their Area Manager.\nProcedure for Auditing\nThe Safe Inventory Log and Audit Form must also be used as an audit schedule to be completed quarterly for Care Homes, and monthly for Retirement Living Schemes, with the aim of reducing / limiting the amount of ‘unknown’ stock in a safe. \nEvery quarter, the administration manager must complete the safe inventory log and audit form, the home or scheme manager must sign their approval. Abandoned items must be recorded on the safe inventory check immediately (see abandoned items sections for more information). Historic checks must be kept for auditing. All safe audits must be retained for 3 years.\nDiagram 3 is a flow chart depicting the quarterly audit process (for care homes):\nProcedure for Returning Money and Valuables when Leaving MHA\nAfter the discharge or death of someone using MHA’s services, the home or scheme must promptly return the individuals personal belongings including money and other valuables stored in the safe to the individuals next of kin or prior agreed representative when they come into the home or scheme to clear the individual’s room or apartment.\nFor Care Homes, the individual’s representative must sign and date the receipt printed from Caresys, which must be countersigned by the member of colleagues dealing with the handover. The Caresys receipt must then be handed to the home or scheme manager to sign to confirm the handover.\nIf the representative is missed when they visit in the home / scheme to clear the room or apartment, the money is to be withdrawn on CareSys and entered onto the PC return as income, stating the residents name. Inform finance that this has been completed and request them to process the refund by adding a note onto the CareSys records.\nThe same procedure would apply if monies were to be returned to the Social Services (in cases where there is no next of kin or representative and take on the responsibility for the individual’s personal monies). The CareSys receipt, must then be handed to the home or scheme manager to sign to confirm the handover.\nIf at the request of the representative, the monies or valuables held are to be donated to MHA, see Donation of Overpaid Resident Fees Policy and Procedure. For Care Homes, this must be clearly documented in Caresys using transaction forms. For Retirement Living Schemes, the Area Manager must be notified. For valuables, follow the abandoned items procedures set out below.\nThe completed deceased individual’s personal monies sheet in Caresys (for care homes only) (using transaction forms) must be retained (not archived) to enable the appropriate compliance to check on the annual financial health check.\nIndividual’s monies held in the income section at Epworth House will automatically be returned to individuals agreed representative when the individual is discharged on Caresys.\nAdministration of Cash Held for an Individual’s Departure\n If an individual leaves the home or scheme to another care provider then the money / valuables held must be passed back to the individual or next of kin and the records appropriately updated, following the same procedure as for a deceased individual.\nIf an individual or their legal representative decides not to claim their items (stored in the safe), follow the procedure for “abandoned items” in section 10.\nProcedure for Unknown Ownership of Items \nCare Homes\nThe procedure for unknown ownership of items refers to all items that fit into the safe, this does not include the likes of bulky items such as furniture. All safe sized items with unknown ownership regardless of perceived value must be dealt with following this procedure.\nIf an item is found or left behind at MHA (regardless of perceived value), Managers must do what they can (in reason) to find the owners of the item. This may include mentioning an item has been lost at relative’s meetings, calling the family members of recently deceased individuals who use the service, or those who have recently left the service. However, Managers are advised to ask the individuals who are informed to describe the lost items rather than a lost item being presented or described directly to them. Managers should seek guidance from their Area Manager for support if needed, or if in doubt. \nAll attempts to find the owner of a lost item must be documented in the Safe Inventory Log and Audit Form as evidence that all reasonable ways to find the owner have been exhausted.\nAfter 6 months (from the item being recorded as lost), the lost item is considered as ‘abandoned’ by law and ownership is transferred to MHA (see next section for abandoned items procedure). All evidence of attempts to find the owners of the items must be recorded, after the items become abandoned and belong to MHA (after 6 months), lost items can no longer be claimed.\nSee Appendix 2 for additional guidance.\nRetirement Living Schemes\nRetirement Living Schemes are not permitted to store valuables on behalf of residents, in exceptional circumstances (for example, a lost valuable is found), the manager should store the item in the safe and contact the NOK as soon as possible to hand the valuable over to them. For advice on this, and for abandoned items, managers should seek support from their Area Manager.\nProcedure for Abandoned Items\nCare Homes\nIf a resident has credit in their personal money account that has been abandoned (in line with eligibility procedure for abandoned items set out in this policy), this can be paid into the homes amenity fund for balances less than £100. For balances over £100, the money can be paid into petty cash fund as a credit to be returned to MHA. All abandoned personal money transfers must be approved by the homes area manager prior to transferring into any fund.\nAll items within the safe that are considered as abandoned (after 6 months) should be dealt with in line with the procedure set out in this policy document. The home must securely dispose of obvious non-value items, such as teeth, club cards bus passes, bank cards, ID cards, passports, driving licences and personal documentation. If any items are identified which may be considered dangerous, the home must contact the Fundraising Team to agree the appropriate course of action.  \nAll other items regardless of perceived value must be sent to MHA’s central support Fundraising Team by guaranteed next day, special delivery (not recorded) to the following address:\nFundraising Team\nMHA, Epworth House, \nStuart St, Derby \nDE1 2EQ\nThe sending date and tracking number must be recorded in the Safe Inventory Log and Audit Form. For any questions on delivery of abandoned items to central support, contact the Fundraising Team at fundraisingenquiries@mha.org.uk.\nColleagues must check through bags and purses and other enclosed objects to double check for valuables such as cash which should be banked locally (amenity funds).\nForeign currency can still be sent to central support as it is exchanged for GBP.\nNote: There is no need to ask permission from Fundraising prior to sending items by special delivery. However, an electronic copy of the Safe Inventory Log and Audit Form should be emailed to the address in 10.1.3 when the package is posted, to alert the team of an impending delivery. The tracking number of the package should be shared with the fundraising team in this email. A copy of the Safe Inventory Log and Audit Form must also be included in the package. Once received and checked, the fundraising team will send a brief email to confirm receipt.  \nRetirement Living Schemes\nRetirement Living Schemes are not permitted to store valuables on behalf of residents, in exceptional circumstances (for example, a lost valuable is found), the manager should store the item in the safe and contact the NOK as soon as possible to hand the valuable over to them. For advice on this, and for abandoned items, managers should seek support from their Area Manager.\nCentral Support Procedure for Abandoned Items\nOnce the package is delivered to the Fundraising Team. the procedure will be as follows (please note, MHA do not value any items, this is completed externally):\nAll items will be logged by the team in a Fundraising held spreadsheet which will include date of item received, the location the item was received from, a brief description of the item including colour, sealed bag number, and the initials of the colleague who logged the items and a second colleague who initials to verify that the item has been logged.\nItems will be sealed in numbered bags (corresponding with spreadsheet) and placed into designated central support location (safe).\nLogged items will be taken to a local (Derby based) auction house on a regular basis for valuing.
