Reducing falls and potential serious injuries are important for maintaining health, wellbeing, and independence amongst the people in all MHA services.  Older people living in care homes are three times more likely to fall than older people living in their own homes, with the results of these falls often being more serious. Many factors can contribute to this heightened risk, such as physical frailty, the presence of long-term conditions, physical inactivity, taking multiple medications and the unfamiliarity of new surroundings. However, in many cases taking the right steps at the right time can actively support an individual and reduce the risk of falls and harm from falls.2 Scope and PurposeThis policy and associated documents, procedures and guidance have been developed in accordance with MHA’s Falls Prevention Strategy, national guidance, and relevant legislation, underpinned by evidence-based practice and providing clear guidance for the assessment, prevention, management, and reporting responsibilities of all falls and falls related incidents. 2.1 This policy, procedures and guidance applies to all colleagues, volunteers and temporary personnel who have responsibility for safely supporting people in all MHA services.2.2 The purpose of this policy document is to:• Raise awareness amongst all colleagues for the need for falls assessment, prevention, and management• Reduce the risk of falling by means of a falls risk assessment and implementation of appropriate interventions for falls prevention• Standardise post falls interventions to reduce the risk of injury • Provide reporting procedures with defined colleague responsibilities for monitoring incidents within MHA’s governance framework3 Definitions TermDefinitionSlip To lose one’s footing and slide unintentionally for a short distance, causing the person to lose their balance.  This is either corrected or causes a person to fallTrip To catch one’s foot o something and accidentally stumble or fall, often over an obstacle, causing the person to lose their balance. This is either corrected or causes a person to fallFall Is defined as an event which results in a person coming to rest inadvertently on the ground or floor.  This is differentiated from a person who is observed to willingly place themselves on the floorMultifactorial Falls Risk Assessment(MFRA) An assessment with multiple components that aims to identify a person’s risk factors for falling [HP118b]Orthostatic Hypotension A drop in blood pressure (BP) on standing a common occurrence in individuals who are unwell and a risk factor for falls (refer to resources, section 10 for nursing homes) RIDDORReporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013If an incident is suspected to fall within the criteria of RIDDOR MHA’s health and safety team should be contacted for advice Hazard Any source of potential damage, harm, or adverse health effects 4 Falls Risk Management - Standard Operating Procedures This section focuses on the prevention of falls and outlines good practice relating to falls and fracture risk assessment and falls support planning. By completing the Falls Preadmission Questionnaire [HP118a] and Multifactorial Falls Risk Screen (MFRS) [HP118b] risk factors can be identified, and action taken to remove or reduce risk where possibleKey things to remember:• A fall is nearly always due to the presence of one or more risk factors.• A person-centred approach should be taken to MFRA and falls support planning.The emphasis should always be on anticipating and preventing falls rather than simply managing falls once they have occurred.4.1 Preadmission Questionnaire4.1.1 All individuals admitted should have a Falls Preadmission Questionnaire completed [HP118a], ideally within 2 weeks of admission and included with the general preadmission assessment or on day one if unable to complete pre-admission4.2 Multifactorial Falls Risk AssessmentThe Multifactorial Falls Risk Assessment includes the identification of the following risk factors in accordance with NICE guidelines:• identification of falls history• cognitive impairment• continence problems• footwear• medication• visual impairment• balance mobility problems• environmental factors• health problems including a diagnosis of osteoporosis4.2.1 All individuals must have a Multifactorial Falls Risk Assessment (MFRA) completed on the first day of admission or day 5 if no history of falls has been identified in the preadmission questionnaire, including people being admitted for respite.4.2.2 The MFRA must be reviewed and updated monthly or in the following circumstances • after every fall• after a hospital admission• when the individual’s environment is changed e.g., move rooms or bed• position	• when there are any significant changes in an individual’s health which mayimpact on their mobility, including medication changes4.2.3 This risk assessment should inform the individuals falls support plan which should include any safeguards to be put in place following the identification of risk. 4.2.4 Where falls safety equipment is required the risk assessment should include details of what type of equipment, when to use and where to position 4.2.5 All appropriate referrals should be made at the initial assessment stage and at subsequent reviews. The individual (and their family where appropriate) should be involved as much as possible with the assessment and any falls prevention strategies which can be followed.4.3 Support Planning The falls support plan will focus on enabling and empowering the individual to keep active while minimising the risk of falling.  It should take into account the importance of choice, rights, independence, and personal outcomes for an individual at all times. Any support required should be clearly recorded.It is essential that a person-centred approach is taken to falls prevention and management and fracture prevention. The individual’s values, preferences, wishes, routines, likes and dislikes should be central.4.3.1 A falls support plan is a working document, which you review monthly and update regularly following the initial MFRA, continually identifying and responding to any falls, change in the resident’s condition or care needs.4.3.2 If possible, colleagues must involve the person in the support planning process.  Colleagues must explain the process to the person so that they understand the reasons there are lots of questions, having lots of discussions, and taking time to get to know the person and their representatives.  A person’s support plan must be reflective of their needs at any given time.4.3.3 If falls safety or sensor equipment is being used, the Falls Equipment Check Record [HP118d] must be referred to in the support plan and commenced to record a visual check completed at each point of care4.3.4 For a person who lacks capacity, colleagues must – • involve them as much as reasonably possible in the process.• record all details in the relevant support plan with regard to responses to any falls assessments and interventions i.e., lying and standing blood pressure check (nursing)• speak to and involve their family but remember that the only person with any legal right is the person’s Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) for health and welfare4.3.5 Refer to Falls and Fractures Risk Prevention Guidelines (Appendix 5) for consideration when completing an individual falls support plan5 Post Falls ProcedureWhat you do at the time of a fall is really important. Safe moving and handling and prompt, appropriate care and attention can greatly improve an individual’s chance of making a full recovery. The immediate care of an individual, following a fall, should include safety at the scene and addressing any injuries sustained. An inappropriate response can delay the diagnosis and treatment of serious injuries.• Residential Care Homes – refer to Post Falls Flowchart (Appendix 2)• Nursing Homes – refer to Post Falls Flowchart (Appendix 3)5.1 Follow the first aid process, Head Injury, Assessment and Monitoring [CP017] and Medical Emergency Procedure [CP031].  A suitably trained member of staff must carry out head to toe checks for signs of injury at the same time as arranging for assistance.5.2 Post Fall - Signs or suspected signs of injury 5.2.1 If there are signs of injury or any uncertainty, colleagues must - a) Not move the person.b) Dial 999 (not 111) for people who have a suspected or obvious injury requiring urgent medical assessment or treatment.c) Administer First Aid.  Colleagues must keep the person warm and as comfortable as possible (pillow, blanket and so on).d) Until the emergency services arrive, start post falls monitoring (HP118c) and continue post falls monitoring for 72 hours if the person is not in hospital.  The purpose of the Post Falls Monitoring Record is to observe for signs of injury and to record these observations.e) Not give the person anything to eat or drink.f) Where there are visible signs of injury – such as deformity or discoloration of skin – complete a Skin Inspection Chart [HP111b].g) Prepare transfer documents and overnight bag (and any other information required locally) 5.2.2 People with known osteoporosis, anticoagulant, antiplatelet or blood thinning medication are more likely to suffer injury as a result of a fall due to the increased risk of ‘hidden’ fractures or bleeding.• Residential colleagues must contact emergency services immediately (999)• Nursing colleagues must complete a physical assessment and clinical observations and contact emergency services (999) If in any doubt, all colleagues must seek urgent medical assistance – 999 call.5.3 Post Fall - No Signs of injury 5.3.1 People with known osteoporosis, anticoagulant, antiplatelet or blood thinning medication are more likely to suffer injury as a result of a fall due to the increased risk of ‘hidden’ fractures or bleeding even if there are no obvious signs of injury.Residential colleagues must contact emergency services immediatelyNursing Homes complete clinical observations and then call 999a) inform the person’s GP as soon as possible.b) immediately start post falls monitoring - looking for pain, bruising, swelling, deformity of limbs, changes to mood / behaviour.c) complete the Post Fall Monitoring Record and• repeat after 30 minutes and then• every 2 hours up to 24 hours and• every 4 hours for another 48 hours - this provides a 72-hour monitoring • period• Head injury has monitoring time scales as defined in CP017.• A doctor may advise and request a variation to the monitoring timescales dependent on the individual, record any advice and action required d) Monitor, record, and action any changes to the person’s condition – seek medical advice.e) If reasonably sure of no hip fracture, return the person to bed / chair using appropriate moving and handling techniques and equipment.f) Nursing only: Record baseline observations (TPR, BP, oxygen saturations, level of consciousness).  Record head injury observations [CP017] if the person has banged their head or had an unwitnessed fall.g) In residential care, colleagues must seek advice from the Community Nurse, GP, or Emergency Services.5.4 Other Actions Required a) Contact the person’s family / representative.b) Make safe any obvious environmental hazard that contributed to the fall. c) Review the person’s Falls Risk Assessment and associated Falls Support Plan – re-write if necessary d) Involve the person and their family or representative in any actions planned to reduce the risk of further falls. e) If required, refer the person to other specialist services (for example NHS Falls Teams if a service of this kind exists in the area).5.5 Reporting All Falls MUST be reported on RADAR even if no physical harm is suspected or reported. RADAR reports provide essential information and incident analysis which is reviewed within MHA’s governance procedures. In addition to RADAR reporting colleagues must complete the following:a) Individual Falls Diary [HP118e] to monitor patterns of falls such as times of day b) If required, notify the Regulator, and / or Safeguarding Team.c) If the fall was due to, or in connection with, a work activity (such as a failing in care, faulty equipment, or an environmental hazard) and where a fall results in a hospital visit and treatment for an injury colleagues must refer to the Health and Safety Team for review and potential RIDDOR reportingd) If there is a serious injury, death, or concerns about how a fall happened, the manager must carry out a root cause analysis investigation with support from MHA’s safeguarding lead.  e) Falls from unrestricted windows are classed as a ‘Never Event’ and the manager must investigate and report in accordance with MHA’s Incident Response and Escalation Policy 6 Roles and ResponsibilitiesRoleResponsibilitiesQuality Governance Group (including H&S) • Maintain and monitor MHA’s internal Governance process • Review system reports identifying organisational risks • Analyse identified risk areas, trends, and patterns• Monitor actions with regard to non-compliance• Agree allocation of resources, as applicable to address any concerns or issuesArea Managers • Responsible for monitoring falls incidents during prescribed audits and visits • Analyse identified risk areas, trends, and patterns• Act on, and report, poor performance and non-compliance• Review concerns with Managers to identify trends, patterns and any action required to manage risks• Disseminate any policy or procedural changes to respective teams • Monitor external reporting i.e., Safeguarding/Adult protection and regulatory bodiesHome Managers and Scheme Managers• Responsible for promoting a culture of excellence in falls prevention and management • Responsible for ensuring all team members involved are aware of this policy and have the required knowledge and skills to deliver the standards expected • Ensure improvements are made where any concerns are identified through audits, monitoring, complaints, and investigations.• Support plan reviews and audits are completed in accordance with MHA’s internal auditing schedules • Support team members to attend relevant training • Provide support and ongoing leadership to promote good practice in the prevention and management of falls• Engage with external professionals, communicating any recommendations to the relevant care teams• Support teams to attend relevant training • Ensure colleagues attend first aid training, risk assessment and support planning training, as required for the role and responsibilities • Report all incidents on RADAR  • Submit regulatory notifications as required i.e., safeguarding Report outcomes of any investigation within Duty of Candour code of practice Quality Improvement ManagersClinical Support Team  • Work with operational colleagues to promote and deliver best practice • Provide support for services as requested• Report progress and concerns accordingly Nurses and Care Teams• Remain accountable and responsible for all aspects of their practice, providing a high standard of care and support • Evidence of regular updating and competency in all aspects of falls prevention and management• Make appropriate and timely referrals to external clinical professionals• Make sure that an individual’s specific needs are documented and communicated to colleagues, • Promote effective and documented communication of individual needs with relevant managers, and care teams• Comply with all aspects of this policy and procedural guidance• Complete all records as described within this policy and procedures, reviewing risk assessments and support plans monthly Highlight any difficulties in understanding and implementing the process and any training requirements 7 Training and Monitoring7.1 All MHA colleagues involved in supporting individuals with assessed needs in relating to falls to read, understand, and comply with this policy and associated procedures7.2 Managers must arrange for colleagues to complete falls training during their induction and every three years thereafter.  Training must be tailored to the type of MHA Service that is being delivered.  7.3 Residential services - basic first aid techniques, post falls monitoring and an emphasis on calling for professional help or emergency services will form the basis of training. 7.4 Where the service is registered to provide nursing care, nursing staff must be trained to understand and assess - • Airway (A), Breathing (B), Circulation (C),• AVPU (rapid assessment of consciousness) – Alert or responds to Vocal stimuli, responds to Painful stimuli, Unresponsive to all stimuli • NEWS (National Early Warning System)• GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) 7.5 Moving and Assisting training should include the identification of possible practical scenarios that might relate to the risk of falls – for example, what to do if a person trips or falls whilst being assisted to walk.7.6 Falls related assessments, support plans and required actions are monitored in accordance with MHA’s internal audit schedules and governance process.  7.7 RADAR reportable falls Incidents are monitored and escalated through the systems dashboard with key responsibilities dependent on role. 8 Communication and Dissemination8.1 This policy is disseminated and implemented within all MHA services through MHA’s channels of communication.8.2 Each colleague’s line manager must ensure that all teams are aware of their roles and responsibilities.8.3 This policy will be available to the people we support and their representatives in alternate formats, as required.8.4 Any review of this policy will include consultation with our colleagues, review of support planning, incident reports, quality audits and feedback from other agencies.8.5 Queries and issues relating to this policy should be referred to the Standards and Policy Team policies@mha.org.uk9 Impact Assessments (Inc.
