# Strategic Overview - Care Policy Management

## Document Structure

1. **policy_taxonomy.json** - The master map defining structure

   - 7 main categories with subcategories
   - Defines where documents should live
   - Guides organization of master files

2. **Master Files** (ending in \_documents.json)

   - resident_health_and_safety_documents.json
   - medication_and_health_management_documents.json
   - resident_rights_and_legal_considerations_documents.json
   - resident_care_and_wellbeing_documents.json
   - operational_and_facility_management_documents.json
   - human_resources_and_staff_training_documents.json
   - documentation_and_reporting_documents.json

3. **all_policies.txt**
   - Complete list of 904 documents
   - Source of truth for all policies
   - Used to verify completeness

## Current Status

1. ✅ Taxonomy structure defined and verified
2. ✅ Restored resident_health_and_safety_documents.json
3. ✅ Added missing sections to medication_and_health_management_documents.json
4. ✅ Added Equality and Inclusion to resident_rights_and_legal_considerations_documents.json
5. ✅ Added Activities and Engagement to resident_care_and_wellbeing_documents.json
6. ✅ Verified kitchen management documents are correctly placed in operational_and_facility_management_documents.json
7. ✅ Moved HR assessment documents to human_resources_and_staff_training_documents.json
8. ✅ Moved clinical risk documents to medication_and_health_management_documents.json
9. ✅ Moved cleaning procedures to operational_and_facility_management_documents.json

## Outstanding Tasks

1. Delete redundant files:
   - ✅ resident_rights_and_legal_considerations.json (deleted)
   - ✅ resident_care_and_wellbeing.json (deleted)
   - ✅ medication_and_health_management.json (deleted)
   - policy.json (to be deleted)
2. Verify document count in each master file
3. Check for any remaining misplaced documents against taxonomy
4. Ensure all 904 documents are properly categorized
5. Final validation against taxonomy structure

## Critical Considerations

- Never overwrite master files
- Each document affects resident care and safety
- Maintain strict alignment with taxonomy
- Document all changes and progress
- Verify counts and completeness

## Next Steps

1. Delete policy.json redundant file
2. Count documents in each master file:
   - resident_health_and_safety_documents.json
   - medication_and_health_management_documents.json
   - resident_rights_and_legal_considerations_documents.json
   - resident_care_and_wellbeing_documents.json
   - operational_and_facility_management_documents.json
   - human_resources_and_staff_training_documents.json
   - documentation_and_reporting_documents.json
3. Compare total count against all_policies.txt (904 documents)
4. Validate all documents align with taxonomy structure
5. Final verification of document categorization
