# Suggested Changes for Document Reorganization

## Current Issues

Several documents appear to be misplaced based on their primary purpose and content.

## Recommended Changes

### 1. Documents to Move from Chronic Illness and Condition Management

- "CSP Household Management" - Consider moving to a new general care management category
- "Consent For Supporting Information Form" - Consider moving to a new administrative/legal category

### 2. Documents to Move from Risk Assessments

Current location: resident_health_and_safety.json > Risk Assessments
Suggested new categories:

#### HR/Personnel Category

- "HR Personal Files Audit Assessment Tool"
- "New and Expectant Colleague Risk Assessment Form"
- "Volunteer DBS Risk Assessment Form"

#### Administrative/Policy Category

- "Equality Impact Assessment (EIA) Process and Guidance"
- "Equality Impact Assessment Form"
- "Data Protection Impact Assessment Form"
- "Quality Assessment Guidance"
- "Legitimate Interest Assessment Form"

## Suggested New Categories

Consider creating:

1. General Care Management

   - For day-to-day care operations documents
   - Would include CSP Household Management

2. Administrative and Legal

   - For administrative procedures, legal requirements, and compliance documents
   - Would include consent forms, data protection, equality assessments

3. HR and Personnel
   - For staff-related documents
   - Would include DBS checks, personnel files, staff risk assessments

## Benefits

- Clearer organization based on document purpose
- Easier navigation for users
- Better separation of clinical, operational, and administrative content
- Reduced risk of confusion about where to find specific documents

## Next Steps

1. Create new top-level categories
2. Move documents to their new locations
3. Update any cross-references or links
4. Review and validate new structure with stakeholders
