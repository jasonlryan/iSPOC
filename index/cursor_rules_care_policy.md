- Mistakes could lead to resident deaths, injuries, or abuse
- Never delete or overwrite master files
- Every document serves a critical safety or care purpose

- Only ADD to master files, never overwrite or delete
- Preserve all existing content
- No comments or placeholders in JSON files

## Document Organization
